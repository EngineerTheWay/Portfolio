# This repository includes copies of my portfolio website, which lists the projects I have worked on throughout self-learning and schools, as well as details about me.
#
# The HTML_CSS folder includes a copy of the website in its most basic form, and was the original website I built while learning basic web development skills and documented them here as I learned.
#
# The HTML_CSS_JS folder includes a later iteration of the same website with the interactivity that comes with JavaScript.
#
# As my skills develop, I plan to continue to document various iterations and modifications of my portfolio site to see how my skills develop and what the various things I learn add to what I have built previously.
