This was my first portfolio website and an early project that helped me build foundational development skills. I started it from scratch while learning through The Odin Project a few years ago and worked on it on and off over the years. It was a project where I explored:
CSS container design elements
Basic JavaScript interactivity
Basic API integration using Cloudflare Workers and a SQLite database

While my goal wasnâ€™t to get into web development, I wanted to get comfortable creating my own site and understand the basics of front-end development. This project taught me a lot about structuring code, container-based design, and integrating a basic API.
